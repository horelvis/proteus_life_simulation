# PROTEUS Topological Evolution Implementation

## Overview
The organisms in PROTEUS now implement true topological evolution, computing movement and inheritance without neural networks or traditional genetics.

## Key Components

### 1. Topological State & Engine
- Each organism has a `TopologicalState` that tracks position, velocity, and trajectory history
- The shared `TopologyEngine` computes movement through topological flow equations
- Movement emerges from field gradients + inherited topological signals + environmental perturbations

### 2. Topological Genome
- 5x5 matrix encoding topological relationships (not genes!)
- Projects organism state through inherited topology to generate movement signals
- Mutates based on trajectory invariants, not random chance

### 3. Topological Inheritance
- Children inherit parent's topological matrix
- Mutations are guided by parent's movement patterns:
  - Spiral movements → develop photosensors
  - Persistent movements → develop better motility
  - Complex trajectories → develop chemoreceptors

### 4. Emergent Behavior
- No neural networks or weights
- Movement computed through: `flow = -gradient + inherited_signal`
- Organs emerge based on topological invariants:
  - Curvature, winding number, persistence, complexity

### 5. Environmental Field
- Predators create repulsive perturbations when attacking
- Safe zones create attractive perturbations
- Field gradients guide movement through topological computation

## Evolution Without Genes
The key insight: behavior patterns (trajectories) determine evolution, not random mutations. Organisms that move in spirals develop eyes. Those that persist develop better movement. The topology of motion becomes the hereditary material.

This implements the core PROTEUS philosophy: "Sin neuronas. Sin pesos. Solo topología pura."
